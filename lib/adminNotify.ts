// TELLING THE ADMINS.
//
// Everyone else on Guestlist gets told when something happens to them. The
// people running it got nothing: a member joined, an article was submitted,
// fifty events landed from an overnight scan, and the only way to find out
// was to open each queue and look.
//
// The shape matters more than the plumbing here. Two rules:
//
// 1. One notification per happening ONLY where the happening is rare. A new
//    member and a submitted article each deserve their own line. A new event
//    does not — one scan can bring in fifty, and fifty bells is a bell nobody
//    reads again.
// 2. Everything that needs a decision is ONE rolling digest per admin, kept
//    current rather than repeated. Reading it clears it; the next change
//    raises a fresh one. The bell means "there is work", not "here is a
//    history of the work count changing".
//
// Nothing in here is allowed to break the thing that triggered it. Somebody
// signing up must not fail because a notification could not be written, so
// every entry point swallows its own errors and says so in the log.
